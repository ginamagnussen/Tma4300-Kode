## Problem A: Coal-mining disaster data
```{r, fig.cap="Plot of cumulative sum of coal-mining disasters as a function of year. \\label{disasters}"}
# Data: Time intervals between successive coal-mining disasters
# years 1851-1962
frame <- data.frame(year = data <- coal[2:190,], disasters = c(1:189))
ggplot(frame) + geom_point(aes(year,disasters))
```

Figure \ref{disasters} shows cumulative sum of disasters as a function of year.
